---

Use this guide to create the minimum required configuration in both Cyral
Control Plane and your AWS account to deploy a Cyral Sidecar to AWS EC2 in front
of two database instances: MySQL and PostgreSQL.

By running this example you will have a fully functional sidecar on your AWS
account. Read the comments and update the necessary parameters as instructed.

See also the [Cyral Sidecar module for AWS EC2](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/cyralinc/sidecar-ec2/aws/latest)
for more details on how the sidecar is deployed to AWS and more advanced configurations.

## Accessing the data repositories

To learn how to access a repository through the sidecar, see [Connect to a
repository](https://cyral.com/docs/connect/repo-connect).

## Enforcing access policies

To attach access policies to the created data repositories, please follow the
guide [Setup policy control over PostgreSQL and MySQL](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cyralinc/cyral/latest/docs/guides/pg_mysql_sidecar_policy).
