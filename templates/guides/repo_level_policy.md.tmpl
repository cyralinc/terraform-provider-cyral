Cyral offers several pre-built [repo-level policy types](https://cyral.com/docs/policy/repo-level/).
In this guide, we provide different examples on how to use them.

We recommend further reading for more details:

* Refer to the [Cyral policies](https://cyral.com/docs/policy/overview/) page in our public
docs for a complete documentation about the Cyral policy framework.
* Refer to the [`cyral_rego_policy_instance`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cyralinc/cyral/latest/docs/resources/rego_policy_instance)
resource for more details about the [template parameters](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/cyralinc/cyral/latest/docs/resources/rego_policy_instance#template-parameters)
and how to use the pre-built repo-level policies in Terraform.
