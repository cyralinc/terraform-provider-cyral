# Cyral Provider

The provider is the base element and must be used to inform application-wide
parameters, like the Cyral control plane reference and authentication secrets.

## Example Usage

- Terraform v12

```terraform
provider "cyral" {
    client_id = ""
    client_secret = ""
    control_plane = "some-cp.cyral.com:8000"
}
```

- Terraform v13+

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    cyral = {
      source = "cyralinc/cyral"
      version = ">= 2.2.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "cyral" {
    client_id = ""
    client_secret = ""
    control_plane = "some-cp.cyral.com:8000"
}
```

### Provider Credentials - UI

#### New Credentials

An `API Client Credentials` account must be created in order to use the provider. It can be created through the control plane UI, accessing the `API Client Credentials` option in the left menu and clicking on the `+` button. Choose a name for the new account and select the following roles so you can use all the provider functions:

Confirm the creation by clicking on the `CREATE` button. This will generate a `Client ID` and a `Client Secret` that should be used in the [provider configuration](#example-usage).

#### Rotate Credentials

To rotate secrets for existing `API Client Credentials`, select a specific account in the UI and then click on the button `ROTATE CLIENT SECRET` as the image below suggests:

That will generate a new `Client Secret` that you can copy and use to replace the old one.

### Provider Credentials - Script

#### New Credentials

An `API Client Credentials` account must be created in order to use the provider. It can be created by the [script provided in the scripts folder](../scripts/create-keycloak-service-account.sh). You can run it with the command below:

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyralinc/terraform-provider-cyral/main/scripts/create-keycloak-service-account.sh -O
bash create-keycloak-service-account.sh
```

#### Rotate Credentials

[This script](../scripts/rotate-keycloak-service-account-secret.sh) can be used to rotate secrets for existing accounts. It can be rotated by running the command below:

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyralinc/terraform-provider-cyral/main/scripts/rotate-keycloak-service-account-secret.sh -O
bash rotate-keycloak-service-account-secret.sh
```
