# cyral_sidecar_bound_ports (Data Source)

Retrieves all the ports of a given sidecar that are currently bound to repositories.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "cyral_sidecar" "sidecar_1" {
  name = "tf-provider-sidecar-1"
  deployment_method = "cloudFormation"
}

resource "cyral_repository" "repo_1" {
  name = "tf-provider-repo-1"
  type = "mysql"
  host = "mysql.com"
  port = 3306
}

resource "cyral_repository_binding" "repo_binding_1" {
  repository_id = cyral_repository.repo_1.id
  sidecar_id = cyral_sidecar.sidecar_1.id
  listener_port = 3306
  enabled = true
}

resource "cyral_repository" "repo_2" {
  name = "tf-provider-repo-2"
  type = "mongodb"
  host = "mongodb.com"
  port = 27017
}

resource "cyral_repository_binding" "repo_binding_2" {
  repository_id = cyral_repository.repo_2.id
  sidecar_id = cyral_sidecar.sidecar_1.id
  listener_port = 27017
  enabled = true
}

data "cyral_sidecar_bound_ports" "this" {
  # Notice that in this case the `depends_on` argument will be
  # needed if you want to retrieve the sidecar bound ports only
  # after the bindings are created/updated. Otherwise, if
  # `depends_on` is omitted, the data source will retrieve the
  # bound ports before creating/updating the bindings, which in
  # this case would return zero ports.
  depends_on = [
    cyral_repository_binding.repo_binding_1,
    cyral_repository_binding.repo_binding_2
  ]
  sidecar_id = cyral_sidecar.sidecar_1.id
}

output "sidecar_bound_ports" {
  value = data.cyral_sidecar_bound_ports.this.bound_ports
}
```
