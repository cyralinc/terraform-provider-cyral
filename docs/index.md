# Cyral Terraform Provider

The Cyral Terraform Provider contains resources that can be used to interact
with the Cyral API through Terraform code. It allows customers to maintain a
history of changes in Cyral environment by transforming configurations into
code and use Terraform to control state changes.

Our provider uses the same naming conventions and organization as stated in
Terraform guidelines for [writing custom providers](https://www.terraform.io/docs/extend/writing-custom-providers.html).

## Version history and compatibility

Please refer to our [Change Log](https://github.com/cyralinc/terraform-provider-cyral/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) to learn about our version
history, its features, bug fixes and Control Plane compatibility.

## How to use this provider

To install this provider, copy and paste this code into your Terraform
configuration. Then, run `terraform init`.

- Terraform 0.13+

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    cyral = {
      source = "cyralinc/cyral"
      version = "~> 4.1"
    }
  }
}

provider "cyral" {
    client_id = ""
    client_secret = ""
    control_plane = "[TENANT].app.cyral.com"
}
```

### Provider Credentials - UI

#### New Credentials

An `API Client` must be created in order to use the provider.
It can be created through the control plane UI, accessing the `API Access Keys`
option in the left menu and clicking on the `+` button. Choose a name for the
new access key and select the following roles so you can use all the provider
functions:

Confirm the creation by clicking on the `CREATE` button. This will generate a
`Client ID` and a `Client Secret` that should be used in the
[provider configuration block](#how-to-use-this-provider).

#### Rotate Credentials

To rotate secrets for existing `API Clients`, access the `API Access Keys` menu
in the UI, select the desired account, click `edit` and finally click
`ROTATE CLIENT SECRET` as the image below suggests:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyralinc/terraform-provider-cyral/main/images/rotate_client_secret.png">

That will generate a new `Client Secret` that you can copy and use to replace
the old one.

## Schema

### Required

- `control_plane` (String) Control plane host and API port (ex: `tenant.app.cyral.com`)

### Optional

- `client_id` (String, Sensitive) Client id used to authenticate against the control plane. Can be ommited and declared using the environment variable `CYRAL_TF_CLIENT_ID`.
- `client_secret` (String, Sensitive) Client secret used to authenticate against the control plane. Can be ommited and declared using the environment variable `CYRAL_TF_CLIENT_SECRET`.
- `tls_skip_verify` (Boolean) Specifies if the client will verify the TLS server certificate used by the control plane. If set to `true`, the client will not verify the server certificate, hence, it will allow insecure connections to be established. This should be set only for testing and is not recommended to be used in production environments. Can be set through the `CYRAL_TF_TLS_SKIP_VERIFY` environment variable. Defaults to `false`.
