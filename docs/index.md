# Cyral Provider

The provider is the base element and must be used to inform application-wide
parameters, like the Cyral control plane reference and authentication secrets.

## Example Usage

- Terraform v12

```terraform
provider "cyral" {
    client_id = ""
    client_secret = ""
    control_plane = "some-cp.cyral.com:8000"
}
```

- Terraform v13+

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    cyral = {
      source = "cyralinc/cyral"
      version = ">= 2.2.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "cyral" {
    client_id = ""
    client_secret = ""
    control_plane = "some-cp.cyral.com:8000"
}
```

### Provider Credentials - UI

#### New Credentials

A `Service Account` must be created in order to use the provider. It can be created through the control plane UI, accessing the `Service accounts` section in the left menu and clicking on the `+` button. Choose a name for the new service account and select the following roles so you can use all the provider functions:

Confirm the account creation by clicking on the `CREATE` button. This will generate a `Client ID` and a `Client Secret` that should be used in the [provider configuration](#example-usage).

#### Rotate Credentials

To rotate secrets for existing service accounts, select a specific service account in the UI, and then click on the button `ROTATE CLIENT SECRET` as the image below suggests:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyralinc/terraform-provider-cyral/main/images/rotate_client_secret.png">

That will generate a new `Client Secret` that you can copy and use to replace the old one.

### Provider Credentials - Script

#### New Credentials

A `Service Account` must be created in order to use the provider. It can be created by the [script provided in the scripts folder](../scripts/create-keycloak-service-account.sh). You can run it with the command below:

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyralinc/terraform-provider-cyral/main/scripts/create-keycloak-service-account.sh -O
bash create-keycloak-service-account.sh
```

#### Rotate Credentials

[This script](../scripts/rotate-keycloak-service-account-secret.sh) can be used to rotate secrets for existing service accounts. It can be rotated by running the command below:

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cyralinc/terraform-provider-cyral/main/scripts/rotate-keycloak-service-account-secret.sh -O
bash rotate-keycloak-service-account-secret.sh
```

## Schema

### Required

- `control_plane` (String) Control plane host and API port (ex: `some-cp.cyral.com:8000`)

### Optional

- `auth0_audience` (String, Deprecated) Auth0 audience.
- `auth0_client_id` (String, Sensitive, Deprecated) Auth0 client id.
- `auth0_client_secret` (String, Sensitive, Deprecated) Auth0 client secret.
- `auth0_domain` (String, Deprecated) Auth0 domain name.
- `auth_provider` (String, Deprecated) Auth0-based control planes are no longer supported. Use `keycloak` or remove the argument declaration.
- `client_id` (String, Sensitive) Client id used to authenticate against the control plane. Can be ommited and declared using the environment variable `CYRAL_TF_CLIENT_ID`.
- `client_secret` (String, Sensitive) Client secret used to authenticate against the control plane. Can be ommited and declared using the environment variable `CYRAL_TF_CLIENT_SECRET`.
- `tls_skip_verify` (Boolean) Specifies if the client will verify the TLS server certificate used by the control plane. If set to `true`, the client will not verify the server certificate, hence, it will allow insecure connections to be established. This should be set only for testing and is not recommended to be used in production environments. Can be set through the `CYRAL_TF_TLS_SKIP_VERIFY` environment variable. Defaults to `false`.
