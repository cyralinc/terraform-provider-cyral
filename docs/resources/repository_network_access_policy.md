# cyral_repository_network_access_policy (Resource)

Manages the network access policy of a repository. Network access policies are also known as the [Network Shield](https://cyral.com/docs/manage-repositories/network-shield/). This feature is supported for the following repository types:

- `sqlserver`
- `oracle`

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Repository the policy refers to
resource "cyral_repository" "my_sqlserver_repo" {
    name = "my-sqlserver-repo"
    type = "sqlserver"
    host = "sqlserver.cyral.com"
    port = 1433
}

# Allow access from IPs 1.2.3.4 and 4.3.2.1 for Admin local
# account, and from any IP address for accounts Engineer and
# Analyst.
resource "cyral_repository_network_access_policy" "my_sqlserver_repo_policy" {
    repository_id = cyral_repository.my_sqlserver_repo.id
    network_access_rule {
        name = "rule1"
        db_accounts = ["Admin"]
        source_ips = ["1.2.3.4", "4.3.2.1"]
    }
    network_access_rule {
        name = "rule2"
        db_accounts = ["Engineer", "Analyst"]
    }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `repository_id` (String) ID of the repository for which to configure a network access policy.

### Optional

- `enabled` (Boolean) Is the network access policy enabled? Default is true.
- `network_access_rule` (Block Set) Network access policy that decides whether access should be granted based on a set of rules. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--network_access_rule))
- `network_access_rules_block_access` (Boolean) Determines what happens if an incoming connection matches one of the rules in `network_access_rule`. If set to true, the connection is blocked if it matches some rule (and allowed otherwise). Otherwise set to false, the connection is allowed only if it matches some rule. Default is false.

### Read-Only
