# cyral_sidecar_credentials (Resource)

Create new [credentials for Cyral sidecar](https://cyral.com/docs/sidecars/sidecar-manage/#rotate-the-client-secret-for-a-sidecar).

Consider using a remote backend to encrypt the state of this resource if it sounds appropriate. For instance:

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    cyral = {
      source = "cyralinc/cyral"
    }
  }
  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "some-s3-bucket"
    key    = "terraform-state.json"
    region = "us-east-1"
    encrypt = true
    dynamodb_table = "some-dynamodb-table"
  }
}
```

This will use a S3 bucket as a remote backend, which will store and encrypt the terraform state while also providing state locking through the DynamoDB table. This is a partial configuration example, so a backend config file containing the AWS `access_key` and `secret_key` is needed. Thus you have to initialize terraform with the following command:

```
terraform init -backend-config=PATH
```

Where `PATH` is the path to the partial configuration file.
