## Schema

### Required

- `mapping` (Block Set, Min: 1) Block that supports mapping attributes in repos to a given label. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--mapping))

### Optional

- `last_updated` (String) Timestamp of the latest update performed on the datamap.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--mapping"></a>

### Nested Schema for `mapping`

Required:

- `data_location` (Block Set, Min: 1) Block to inform a data location set: repository name and attributes specification. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--mapping--data_location))
- `label` (String) Label given to the data specified in the corresponding list .

<a id="nestedblock--mapping--data_location"></a>

### Nested Schema for `mapping.data_location`

Required:

- `attributes` (Set of String) List containing the specific locations of the data within the repo, following the pattern `{SCHEMA}.{TABLE}.{ATTRIBUTE}` (ex: `[your_schema_name.your_table_name.your_attr_name]`).

> Note: When referencing data in Dremio repository, please include the complete location in `attributes`, separating spaces by dots. For example, an attribute `my_attr` from table `my_tbl` within space `inner_space` within space `outer_space` would be referenced as `outer_space.inner_space.my_tbl.my_attr`. For more information, please see the [Policy Guide](https://cyral.com/docs/reference/policy/).

- `repo` (String) Name of the repository containing the data as specified through the Cyral management console.
