<a id="nestedblock--mapping"></a>

### Nested Schema for `mapping`

Required:

- `attributes` (List of String) List containing the specific locations of the data within the repo, following the pattern `{SCHEMA}.{TABLE}.{ATTRIBUTE}` (ex: `[your_schema_name.your_table_name.your_attr_name]`).

For example, an attribute `my_attr` from table `my_tbl` within space `inner_space` within space `outer_space` would be referenced as `outer_space.inner_space.my_tbl.my_attr`. For more information, please see the [Policy Guide](https://cyral.com/docs/reference/policy/).
