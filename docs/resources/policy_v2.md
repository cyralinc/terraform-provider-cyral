# cyral_policy_v2 (Resource)

This resource allows management of various types of policies in the Cyral platform. Policies can be used to define access controls, data governance rules, and approval mechanisms to ensure compliance and security within your database environment.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "cyral_policy_v2" "local_policy_example" {
  name        = "local_policy"
  description = "Local policy to allow gym users to read their own data"
  enabled     = true
  tags        = ["gym", "local"]
  scope {
    repo_ids = ["2gaWEAyeKbETyUy1LSx985gVqrk"]
  }
  document    = jsonencode({
