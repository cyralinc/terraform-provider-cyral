# cyral_policy_rule (Resource)

Manages [policy rules](https://cyral.com/docs/reference/policy/#rules). See also: [Policy](./policy.md)

> Notes:
>
> 1. Unless you create a default rule, users and groups only have the rights you explicitly grant them.
> 2. Each contexted rule comprises these fields: `data`, `rows`, `severity` `additional_checks`, `dataset_rewrites`. The only required fields are `data` and `rows`.
> 3. The rules block does not need to include all three operation types (reads, updates and deletes); actions you omit are disallowed.
> 4. If you do not include a hosts block, Cyral does not enforce limits based on the connecting client's host address.

For more information, see the [Policy Guide](https://cyral.com/docs/policy#the-rules-block-of-a-policy).

## Schema

### Required

- `policy_id` (String) The ID of the policy you are adding this rule to.

### Optional

- `deletes` (Block List) A contexted rule for accesses of the type `delete`. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--deletes))
- `hosts` (List of String) Hosts specification that limits access to only those users connecting from a certain network location.
- `identities` (Block List, Max: 1) Identities specifies the people, applications, or groups this rule applies to. Every rule except your default rule has one. It can have 4 fields: `db_roles`, `groups`, `users` and `services`. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--identities))
- `reads` (Block List) A contexted rule for accesses of the type `read`. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--reads))
- `updates` (Block List) A contexted rule for accesses of the type `update`. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--updates))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--deletes"></a>

### Nested Schema for `deletes`

Required:

- `data` (List of String) The data locations protected by this rule. Use `*` if you want to define `any` data location. For more information, see the [policy rules](https://cyral.com/docs/policy/rules#contexted-rules) documentation.
- `rows` (Number) The number of records (for example, rows or documents) that can be accessed/affected in a single statement. Use positive integer numbers to define how many records. If you want to define `any` number of records, set to `-1`.

Optional:

- `additional_checks` (String) Constraints on the data access specified in [Rego](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/). See [Additional checks](https://cyral.com/docs/policy/rules/#additional-checks).
- `dataset_rewrites` (Block List) Defines how requests should be rewritten in the case of policy violations. See [Request rewriting](https://cyral.com/docs/policy/rules/#request-rewriting). (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--deletes--dataset_rewrites))
- `rate_limit` (Number) Rate Limit specifies the limit of calls that a user can make within a given time period.
- `severity` (String) severity level that's recorded when someone violate this rule. This is an informational value. Settings: (`low` | `medium` | `high`). If not specified, the severity is considered to be low.
