This guide will take you through the steps required to upgrade your Cyral Terraform provider
to version 3.0.0. The Terraform migration can be performed on any Cyral Terraform provider with
version 2.x. There is no need to upgrade to an intermediate version before upgrading to 3.0. 
The migration will be handled by an interactive Bash script. 

## Prerequisites

The Terraform 3.0 Migration Script requires the following tools: 

  * Terraform CLI. Download instructions can be found [here](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli). 

  * JQ. Download instructions can be found [here](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/). 

The script will exit if either of these tools are not installed.

## Running the Script

You can find the Cyral Terraform 3.0 Migration script [here](https://github.com/cyralinc/terraform-provider-cyral/tree/main/docs/guides/scripts/3.0-migration.sh).
